Process of building a website

1. Define the Project
- who is it for? client? yourself?
- what is the website for? providing info? selling something? entertaining?
- define a target audience. be very specific!
  - Ex: women, 20-40 yrs old, in Europe, earning around $2000/month, passion for dogs

2. Plan the Project
- based on business goals, user goals and target audience
- plan and gather website content: text, images, videos, etc
  - content is usually provided by client, but you can also help
- for bigger sites, plan out a sitemap. what pages the site needs and how they relate to one another
- based on the content, plan what sections each page needs to convey the contents message, and in which order
- content guides the project and design
- define website personality

3. Sketch Layout and Component Ideas
- think about what content you need and how you can use them in layout patterns
- get ideas out of your head. sketch them on pen and paper or use software like figma. simple sketches
- this is an iterative process. experiment with different layouts and ideas until you reach a good solution
- you dont need to sketch everything. not everything needs to be perfect before youre ready to jump into the code
- dont start coding until you have a rough sketch

4. Design and Build Site
- Use decisions, content and sketches from Steps 1-3 to design and build the site with HTML/CSS
- after the layout and components are done, you need to design the visual styles
- create design based on website personality, design guidelines and inspiration
- use the clients branding for design decisions whenever possible: colors, typography, icons, etc

5. Test and Optimize
- make sure website works for all the major browsers
- test on actual mobile device (not just devtools)
- optimize all images
- fix simple accessibility issues
- run lighthouse performance test in Chrome's devtools and try to fix any reported issues
- think about search engine optimization (SEO)

6. Launch
- upload to a hosting platform (Netlify)
- choose/buy an appropriate domain name. should represent brand

7. Maintain and Update
- keep website updated over time
- Install analytics software (google analytics, fathom) to get stats from the users. this could influence future changes to the site structure and content
- a blog is a good way to keep users coming back and good for SEO

Responsive design ingredients:
- Fluid layouts
  - allows webpage to adapt to current viewport height/width
  - use % (or vh/vw) unit instead of px that should adapt to viewport
  - use max-width instead of width

- Responsive units
  - use rem instead of px
  - makes it easy to scale the layout down/up
  - setting 1rem to 10px for easy calculations

- Flexible images
  - images dont scale automatically as the viewport is changed. must be coded
  - always use % for image dimensions together with max-width

- Media Queries
  - bring responsive sites to life
  - changes CSS styles on certain viewport widths (breakpoints)

- Desktop first vs Mobile first
  - desktop first: write CSS for big screens, use media queries to adjust for small screens
  - mobile first: write CSS for small screens, use media queries to adjust for big screens
    - forces to reduce websites/apps to absolute essentials

- max-width
  - responsive
  - if the width of the container is bigger than the max-width of an element, the width of the element will be max-width. if the container is smaller, than the width of the element will match that width
  - this is a better practice than just width and %

- rem (root em)
  - based off the font-size of the root element (html element)
  - if not defined in html element, it will usually be 16px

  - when defining a root font-size for rem, use %. this allows us to respect any font-size change from the user
  - Ex: html {
      font-size: 10px; ❌
      font-size: 62.5%; ✅
  }
    - if the user changes their font size to 18px, then rems will be a percentage of that rather than a hard coded 10px


NOTES ON HEADER:
- header should be widest thing on page. sticky
  - flexbox
- Nav: make an ul and style the li's.
  - last li in the list may be a different styled cta
    - give it a unique class or use :last-child
  - add visual changes when hovering
  - flexbox baby
  - dont forget to make links inline-block to apply padding on all four sides

NOTES ON HERO: 
- grid works great if using two parts for your hero.
- flex for the inside parts of hero to adjust how you want
- make sure to emphasize the more important cta if there is more than one
- tinker with line-height, font weight and font size for any text
- when using multiple images with faces, give them a small border to add a little design element

- make utility classes (in a different css file if needed) for anything that doesnt need to be added to a unique class

NOTES ON HOW IT WORKS:
- if height is not being applied to an element, then you can use padding-bottom to add height
- fill in spaces with designs

NOTES ON FEATURED IN:
- making logos the same color and gray. use:
  - filer: brightness(0);
  - opacity: 50%; (this value can be whatever)

NOTES ON MEALS:
- icons that use html elements are easier than full svgs
- flex is perfect to add space between elements
- even though entire page is mostly left aligned, you can center one section to make it come together
- use reusable classes and keep them strict. if you need to modify a reusable class, add a utility class instead
  - containter and grid!

NOTES ON TESTIMONIALS:
- use <figure> blocks for things like this that is good for the img, quote (<blockquote>) and caption (<figcaption>)
- <figcaption> can only be used inside of a <figure> element
- images are inherently inline elements which add a tiny sliver of space in between. to remove this, make the images block elements
- on grid-template-columns you can use numbers like percentages accompanied with fr to adjust more precisely
  - Ex: grid-template-columns: 55fr 45fr;
- overflow: hidden to hide overflow on animations

NOTES ON PRICING/FEATURES
- helper classes!
- emphasize important parts (prices, other data)
- demphasize non important parts or cards
- pay attention to spaacing

- inline elements cannot have margin/padding on top and bottom, only left and right.
- block and inline-block elements can have margin/padding on all sides
  - margin: 0 auto only applies to block elements as well. (not inline-block)
