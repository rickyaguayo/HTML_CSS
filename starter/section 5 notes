SECTION 5 - WEB DESIGN

Web design vs Web Developer
- Web designers create the overall look and feel of the website
- Web developers implement the design using HTML, CSS and JS

Good design: 
- creates an immediate lasting good impression of the brand/product
- makes the user trust the brand right away
- increases the perceived value of the brand/product
- gives users exactly what theyre looking for when coming to the site

Bad design: 
- makes users believe they dont really care about the brand/product
- makes the user insecure about trusting the brand/product
- makes the brand/product seem cheap
- leaves users confused and makes it hard for them to reach their goal 

Web Design ingredients: 
  1. Typography
  2. Colors
  3. Images/illustrations
  4. Icons
  5. Shadows
  6. Border radius
  7. Whitespace
  8. Visual Heirarchy
  9. User Experience
  10. Components/layouts

Web personalities:
  1. Serious/Elegant: For luxury and elegance. based on thin serif typefaces, golden or pastel colors and big high quality images
  2. Minimalist/simple: focuses on the essntial text context, using small or medium sized sans-serif black text, line and few images and icons
  3. Plain/neutral: design that gets out of the way by using neutral and small typefaces, and a very structured layout. Common amongst big companies like Microsoft
  4. Bold/confident: makes an impact by featuring big and bold typography paired with confident big and bright colored blocks
  5. Calm/peaceful: for products and services that care, transmitted by calming pastel colors, soft serif headings and matching images/illustrations
  6. Startup/upbeat: widely used in startups, featuring medium sized typefaces, light gray text and backgrounds and rounded elements
  7. Playful/fun: colorful and round designs, fueled by creative elements like hand drawn icons illustrations, animations and fun language

~~~TYPFACE~~~
Serif:
  - creates a traditional/classic look and feel
  - conveys trustworthiness
  - good for long text

Sans-serif:
  - modern look and feel
  - clean and simple
  - easier to choose for beginner designers

- Use only good/modern typefaces
  - Sans-serif: Inter, Open Sans, Roboto, Monserrat, Lato, Work Sans
  - Serif: Merriweather, Aleo, Playfair Display, Cormorant, Cardo, Lora
- use only one typeface per page. If you need multiple, limit to 2 
- choose the right typeface for your website personality
  - decide between serif and sans-serif
  - experiment with typefaces to find one that fits
  - don't be scared to try different ones even while designing/developing

- when choosing font sizes, limit choices. use a type scale tool or a predefined range
- for normal text, use font sized between 16px and 32px 
- for long text (like a blog post), try 20px or above
- for headlines, you can go big. 50px and above with 600 boldness. depends on personality
- for any text, dont use font weight below 400. 400 is normal. this may cause unreadablilty
- good to have a system in place for font size and spacing. (type-scale.com)
  - helps with scrambling with different sizes 

- use less than 75 characters per line
- for normal sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and 2. for big text, go below 1.5.
  - the smaller and longer the text is, the larger the line height needs to be.
- decrease the letter spacing in headlines if it looks unnatural
- experiment with all caps for short titles. make them small, bold and decrease letter spacing
- dont justify text
- dont center long text block. short ones are usually fine

~~COLORS~~
- make the colors match the personality. colors convey meaning
  - see screenshot for meanings of colors
- use a good color tone. nothing random
  - tools: open color, tailwindcss, flat ui colors 2 
- in any color palatte, you need 2 colors. a main color and a grey color
  - grey doesnt necessarily mean grey. it can be a dark version of any color
- an accent color can also be added if wanted. as long as it fits with the main and grey
  - tools: coolor or palleton
- for diversity, create lighter (tints) and darker (shades) versions of your colors
  - tools: tint & shade generator
- use main color to draw attention to the most important parts of the page. (CTAs, logo, etc)
- use colors to add interesting accents or make entire components/sections stand out
- you can use the colors strategically in images and illustrations
- on dark colored backgrounds, try using a tint (lighter version) of the background for the text
- text should usually not be completely black. this can be heavy and uninviting. best to lighten it up
- dont make it too light. use a tool to check contrast between background and text.
  - important for accebility reasons
  - contrast needs to be 4.5:1 for normal text. 3:1 for large text (18px+)

~~IMAGES~~
- different kinds of images: product photos, storytelling photos, illustrations and patterns
- images support website's message and story. only use relevant images
- original images are best. people look for authenticity. do not use overused, generic images 
  - tools: unsplash, pexels, drawkit, undraw
- use images with real people. can trigger user's emotion
- crop image to fit message
- experiment with combining photos, illustrations and patterns
- text on images
  - darken or brighten image for readability
  - position text into neutral area of image
  - put text into a box with
- to account for high res screens, make images 2x the display size (scale factor)
  - if the image in the code is 300x300, the image should be at least 600x600
  - scale factor: actual pixels the screen contains divided by pixels represented on the screen
  - on high res screens scale factor can be 2-3x (2-3 pixels are representing 1 actual screen pixel)
- compress images for a lower file size and better performance
- when using images side by side, make sure they have the same aspect ratio

~~ICONS~~
- use good icon packs. loads of free (and paid) ones
  tools: phosphor icons, ionicons, icons8
- use only one icon pack. dont mix
- use svg icons or icon fonts. dont use .png or .jpg for icons
  - svgs are vector based meaning they can scale indefinitely without getting blurry
- when picking icon packs, adjust to the website's personality
  - match roundness, weight and fill/outline to the chosen typography
- use icons:
  - to provide visual assitance to text
  - for feature blocks
  - associated with actions and label them (unless there is no space or the icon is 100% clear)
  - as bullet points
- to keep icons neutral use the same color as the text. to attract attention to them, a different color
- dont confuse the user. icons need to fit the text or action
- dont make icons larger than what they were designed for. enclose them in a shape if needed

~~SHADOWS~~
- shadows create depth/3D effect
- in the last 15 years, trends have gone from shadows -> flat -> flat/shadow hybrid
- use shadows well:
  - shadows arent needed if it doesnt fit the website personality
    - less shadows for serious/elegant. more for playful/fun
  - use shadows in small doses. everything doesnt need it
  - go light on shadows. dark shadows look unnatrual
- when to use shadows: 
  - use small shadows for small elements that need to stand out
    - ctas, forms, small images, etc
  - use medium sized shadows for larger areas that should stand out a bit more
    - entire sections, cards, info panels, etc
  - use large shadows for areas that should really float above the interface
    - navigations, modals, etc
  - experiement with mouse interaction (hover and click)
  - experiement with glows (colored shadows)
- box-shadow can have 5 values:
  Ex: box-shadow: 10px 10px 10px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0,1)
  - first value is x-axis offset. negative value means left
  - second value is y-axis offset. negative value means top
  - third value is blur-radius. the higher the value, the blurrier
  - fourth value is spread-radius. the higher the value, the more it will spread
  - fifth value is the color of the shadow. default is black
- text-shadow can be used for text

~~BORDER RADIUS~~
- increase playfulness/fun of the design. makes it looks less serious
  - the less border radius makes it seem more serious
- typefaces have a certain amount of roundness. match the border radius to that
- use border radius on images, buttons, around icons, standout sections, etc
- when adding a border radius, pixels tend to work best
  - percentages will turn the element into an oval/circle
  - the max amount of pixels that can be given to an element is dependent on its height
    - you can give it more pixels, but nothing will happen after its height
