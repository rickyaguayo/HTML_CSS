SECTION 5 - WEB DESIGN

Web design vs Web Developer
- Web designers create the overall look and feel of the website
- Web developers implement the design using HTML, CSS and JS

Good design: 
- creates an immediate lasting good impression of the brand/product
- makes the user trust the brand right away
- increases the perceived value of the brand/product
- gives users exactly what theyre looking for when coming to the site

Bad design: 
- makes users believe they dont really care about the brand/product
- makes the user insecure about trusting the brand/product
- makes the brand/product seem cheap
- leaves users confused and makes it hard for them to reach their goal

Web personalities:
  1. Serious/Elegant: For luxury and elegance. based on thin serif typefaces, golden or pastel colors and big high quality images
  2. Minimalist/simple: focuses on the essntial text context, using small or medium sized sans-serif black text, line and few images and icons
  3. Plain/neutral: design that gets out of the way by using neutral and small typefaces, and a very structured layout. Common amongst big companies like Microsoft
  4. Bold/confident: makes an impact by featuring big and bold typography paired with confident big and bright colored blocks

  7. Playful/fun: colorful and round designs, fueled by creative elements like hand drawn icons illustrations, animations and fun language

~~~TYPFACE~~~
Serif:
  - creates a traditional/classic look and feel
  - conveys trustworthiness
  - good for long text

Sans-serif:
  - modern look and feel
  - clean and simple
  - easier to choose for beginner designers

- Use only good/modern typefaces
  - Sans-serif: Inter, Open Sans, Roboto, Monserrat, Lato, Work Sans
  - Serif: Merriweather, Aleo, Playfair Display, Cormorant, Cardo, Lora
- use only one typeface per page. If you need multiple, limit to 2 
- choose the right typeface for your website personality
  - decide between serif and sans-serif
  - experiment with typefaces to find one that fits
  - don't be scared to try different ones even while designing/developing

- when choosing font sizes, limit choices. use a type scale tool or a predefined range
- for normal text, use font sized between 16px and 32px 
- for long text (like a blog post), try 20px or above
- for headlines, you can go big. 50px and above with 600 boldness. depends on personality
- for any text, dont use font weight below 400. 400 is normal. this may cause unreadablilty
- good to have a system in place for font size and spacing. (type-scale.com)
  - helps with scrambling with different sizes 

- use less than 75 characters per line
- for normal sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and 2. for big text, go below 1.5.
  - the smaller and longer the text is, the larger the line height needs to be.
- decrease the letter spacing in headlines if it looks unnatural
- experiment with all caps for short titles. make them small, bold and decrease letter spacing
- dont justify text
- dont center long text block. short ones are usually fine

~~COLORS~~
- make the colors match the personality. colors convey meaning
  - see screenshot for meanings of colors
- use a good color tone. nothing random
  - tools: open color, tailwindcss, flat ui colors 2 
- in any color palatte, you need 2 colors. a main color and a grey color
  - grey doesnt necessarily mean grey. it can be a dark version of any color
- an accent color can also be added if wanted. as long as it fits with the main and grey
  - tools: coolor or palleton
- for diversity, create lighter (tints) and darker (shades) versions of your colors
  - tools: tint & shade generator
- use main color to draw attention to the most important parts of the page. (CTAs, logo, etc)
- use colors to add interesting accents or make entire components/sections stand out
- you can use the colors strategically in images and illustrations
- on dark colored backgrounds, try using a tint (lighter version) of the background for the text
- text should usually not be completely black. this can be heavy and uninviting. best to lighten it up
- dont make it too light. use a tool to check contrast between background and text.
  - important for accebility reasons
  - contrast needs to be 4.5:1 for normal text. 3:1 for large text (18px+)
