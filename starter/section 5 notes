SECTION 5 - WEB DESIGN

Web design vs Web Developer
- Web designers create the overall look and feel of the website
- Web developers implement the design using HTML, CSS and JS

Good design: 
- creates an immediate lasting good impression of the brand/product
- makes the user trust the brand right away
- increases the perceived value of the brand/product
- gives users exactly what theyre looking for when coming to the site

Bad design: 
- makes users believe they dont really care about the brand/product
- makes the user insecure about trusting the brand/product
- makes the brand/product seem cheap
- leaves users confused and makes it hard for them to reach their goal

~~~TYPFACE~~~
Serif:
  - creates a traditional/classic look and feel
  - conveys trustworthiness
  - good for long text

Sans-serif:
  - modern look and feel
  - clean and simple
  - easier to choose for beginner designers

- Use only good/modern typefaces
  - Sans-serif: Inter, Open Sans, Roboto, Monserrat, Lato, Work Sans
  - Serif: Merriweather, Aleo, Playfair Display, Cormorant, Cardo, Lora
- use only one typeface per page. If you need multiple, limit to 2 
- choose the right typeface for your website personality
  - decide between serif and sans-serif
  - experiment with typefaces to find one that fits
  - don't be scared to try different ones even while designing/developing

- when choosing font sizes, limit choices. use a type scale tool or a predefined range
- for normal text, use font sized between 16px and 32px 
- for long text (like a blog post), try 20px or above
- for headlines, you can go big. 50px and above with 600 boldness. depends on personality
- for any text, dont use font weight below 400. 400 is normal. this may cause unreadablilty

- use less than 75 characters per line
- for normal sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and 2. for big text, go below 1.5.
  - the smaller and longer the text is, the larger the line height needs to be.
- decrease the letter spacing in headlines if it looks unnatural
- experiment with all caps for short titles. make them small, bold and decrease letter spacing
- dont justify text
- dont center long text block. short ones are usually fine
