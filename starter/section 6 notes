~~COMPONENTS AND LAYOUT PATTERNS~~
- webpages start with elements that can be built into components, which can be turned to layouts, that eventually turn into the webpage.
- use common elements and components to convey your website's information
- combine components into layouts using common layout patterns
- assemble different layout areas into a complete, final page
- elements -> compontents -> sections -> layouts
  - see slides for breakdown of each

- when changing the flex direction from row (default) to column, the main axis is rotated 90 degrees
  - the main axis goes from horizontal to vertical
  - same goes with the cross axis (perpindicular axis to main axis)
- this applies to align-items, justify-content and gap
  - align-items aligns items horizontally instead of vertically
  - justify-content aligns items vertically instead of horizontally
  - gap acts like margin-bottom instead of margin-right
