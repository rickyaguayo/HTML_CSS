MEDIA QUERIES

- piece of code used to overwrite specific styles
- if there is conflict between media queiries, the one written last will be applied
- rem/em do not respond to font sized set in the html tag in media queiries. they only respond the default browser font size. (usually 16px)
  - this means the media tag itself. inside the tag still responds to the font size set in the html tag
- in some browsers, rem can be buggy with media queiries. em is better in this case
- by sizing everything using rem when initially building, everything can easily be changed by changing the font size in the html tag.
- media queiries should work for every 200-300 pixels

- inline elements can be affected by text-align: center
- transitions do not work when an element has display:none
  - use opacity: 0 instead
