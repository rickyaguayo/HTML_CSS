SECTION 2 - HTML

- HTML: HyperText Markup Language. It's a markup language (used to structure and describe content). Not a programming language
- only one h1 per page
- use <strong> over <b> because strong has semantic value
- use <em> over <i> because em (emphasis) has semantic value
- alt tags help tells search engines wahts in the image
- anchor element without href doesnt act as a link. the href is what converts and a tag to a link
- semantic HTML means using certain tags for certain purposes
  - also helps with accessibilty and analysis for search engines
