SECTION 2 - HTML

- HTML: HyperText Markup Language. It's a markup language (used to structure and describe content). Not a programming language
- only one h1 per page
- use <strong> over <b> because strong has semantic value
- use <em> over <i> because em (emphasis) has semantic value
- alt tags help tells search engines wahts in the image
- anchor element without href doesnt act as a link. the href is what converts and a tag to a link
- semantic HTML means using certain tags for certain purposes
  - also helps with accessibilty and analysis for search engines


SECTION 3 - CSS

- unitless line-height is the value times the font size
  Ex: 
    font-size: 16
    line-height: 2 (line hieght is 32px)
- when colors in all 3 channels (rgb) are the same, it yields a gray
  - #444444 
  - rgb(183, 183, 183)
  - there are 156 pure grays to choose from
- :nth-child() takes keywords
  - Ex: li:nth-child(even) { color: red }
- when using psuedo classes like first or last child to select, it will choose the actual first/last child
  - article p:first-child {}. This will only work if the first child of the article is a p, otherwise nothing will happen
- :link targets anything with an href attribute
  - Ex: a:link { color: red }
- text-decoration can also take values like border
  - Ex: text-decoration: underline dotted #f7f7f7
- define link psuedo classes in order of :link, :visited, :hover, then :active (LHVA)
- CSS heirarchy:
  1. !important
  2. Inline styles
  3. Id selectors
  4. Class or psuedo class selectors
  5. Element selectors
  6. Universal selectors
- most inherited styles are related to text. font-family, font-size, color, etc.
  - not all properties from parent elements get inherited. like border
  - universal selector is used to inherit all properties to elements
