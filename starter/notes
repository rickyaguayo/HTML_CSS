SECTION 2 - HTML

- HTML: HyperText Markup Language. It's a markup language (used to structure and describe content). Not a programming language
- only one h1 per page
- use <strong> over <b> because strong has semantic value
- use <em> over <i> because em (emphasis) has semantic value
- alt tags help tells search engines whats in the image
- anchor element without href doesnt act as a link. the href is what converts and a tag to a link
- semantic HTML means using certain tags for certain purposes
  - also helps with accessibilty and analysis for search engines


SECTION 3 - CSS

- unitless line-height is the value given times the font size
  Ex: 
    font-size: 16px
    line-height: 2 (line height is 32px)
- when colors in all 3 channel pairs are the same, it yields a gray
  - #f7f7f7 
  - rgb(183, 183, 183)
  - there are 256 pure grays to choose from
- :nth-child() takes keywords
  - Ex: li:nth-child(even) { color: red }
- when using psuedo classes like first or last child to select, it will choose the actual first/last child
  - article p:first-child {}. This will only work if the first child of the article is a p, otherwise nothing will happen
- :link targets anything with an href attribute
  - Ex: a:link { color: red }
- text-decoration can also take values like border
  - Ex: text-decoration: underline dotted #f7f7f7
- define link psuedo classes in order of :link, :visited, :hover, then :active (LHVA)
- CSS heirarchy:
  1. !important
  2. Inline styles
  3. Id selectors
  4. Class or psuedo class selectors
  5. Element selectors
  6. Universal selectors
- most inherited styles are related to text. font-family, font-size, color, etc.
  - not all properties from parent elements get inherited. like border
  - universal selector is used to inherit all properties to elements
- border is still considered to be inside the element
- CSS Box Model: 
  - Content: text, images, etc
  - Border: a line around the element still inside of the element
  - Padding: Invisible space around the content, inside of the element
  - Margin: Space outside of the element, between elements
  - Fill area: Area that gets filled with background color of background image. This includes the content and the padding, but not the border
- default height and width (no border-box) is calculated by adding border + padding + content
  - with border-box property, the margin is included
- when adding space between sections. margin-bottom is recommended
- collapsing margins: when two margins occupy the same space, they are not added together. Only one (the bigger one) will be visible. 
  Ex: <p>upper</p>
      <h3>lower</h1>

      p {
        margin-bottom: 15px;
      }

      h3 {
        margin-top: 40px;
      }
  - the space between will be only 40px. not 55px
  - this changes with border-box
